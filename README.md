# Getting Started with Game Lister

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Functionality

This project is mainly focuse on the back end using a combo of Avtive Record, Ruby and Sinatra to build an API where request/response works flawlessly with React components.

One-to-many relationship between Gaming Platforms and Games.
Platforms have many games and games belong to platforms.

Platforms has GET/POST functionality.
Games is full CRUD.

React code is minimal and simple, my focus was to build an API and have it interact with React, such as request/response flow for CRUD methods and table relations.

### Home Page

This is the default page where the journey begins with basic instructions on how the app works.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.game

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
